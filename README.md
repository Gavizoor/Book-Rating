In this project, I examined the rating and reference of books according to registered users.
At first, I use Spark & Spark SQL for same data preparation.
After, I load the fixed CSV to Tableau prep for some more corrections and join all CSV tables.
Last thing, was load it all to Tableau desktop and show trends in dashbord.
The conclusions can be seen in the power point file
